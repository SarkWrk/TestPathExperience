# 1.0.0 (beta)
- **Major Changes**:
  - AI:
    - When creating an AI the parameters will be put in a table. (Still the same parameters names.)
  - CombatAI:
    - Now calls on a module script that contains a class for shooting bullets.
- AI:
  - New parameter "difficulty".
- CombatAI:
  - Changed `self.WeaponInformation.GunStatistics.ShotDelay` from seconds to shots/min.
  - Added the ability to throw grenades.
  - Added difficulty scaling located under: `self.Information.Difficulty`.
    - Difficulty is clamped as (-inf, 1000].
    - Spread scales via the equation: spread/100 * (100 + (100 - difficulty/5)).
    - Grenade throw cooldown scales via the equation: cooldown - difficulty/0.0015.
    - Maximum grenades scales via: inf-1000 difficulty → 10, 999-750 difficulty → 7, 749-500 difficulty → 5, 499-250 difficulty → 2, 249-100 difficulty → 1, 99- -inf difficulty → 0
  - If `self.WeaponInformation.Target.Favoured` is nil, `self.Information.ViewAlignment` will be disabled. (Aka, the rig will not be staring at the last target.)
  - If the script doesn't see an enemy, then `self.WeaponInformation.Target.Favoured` is set to nil.
- PathfindingAI:
  - Fixed a bug where `self.ImportantInformation.stateManagerScript<Walkspeed>` would not get reset when the rig could no longer see an enemy.
  - Will try to avoid the closest grenade within `self.Shootingfunctions.GrenadeAvoidanceRange`.
    - After the grenade is `self.Shootingfunctions.GrenadeAvoidanceRange` studs away, will recalculate a forced path to the target.
